// Window Object = browser api, the way browser gives us an option to work with it. It gives us objects and properties that we can use to access browser and work wiht the browser
// document
// console.dir

// It's always gonna look at the window so
// no need for window.alert(), for example
// just do alert(), same works for document

// document is an object itself that comes with a window object
// You'll only get the document structure
console.log(document);
console.log(window);

// console.dir(), to find out what kind of properties as well as methods we have on a node object that you selected
